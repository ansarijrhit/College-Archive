Each of these files in the ../TestScripts folder contains a 
test script for exactly one of the Sequence operations.

Use file redirection to run these test scripts
on a Sequence command interpreter.

You can use Windows Batch Scripting to write a batch script that will
run all these test script files on your Sequence command interpreter
with just one command.

An example of how this can be done can be found in "runScripts.bat"
which is in the same folder as this readme file.

Read the contents of "runScripts.bat", then double click it to run it.
